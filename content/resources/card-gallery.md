## Ask Max

{{< figure src="/cards/ask-max.png" alt="Let's ask Max, eh?" >}}

The Ask Max Method, in a card. Use it with great care and a grain of salt: the method isn't designed to be used in a chat format, where the chat history might be contaminated by previous exchanges. But it has an embedded lorebook that includes each of the types of prompts in a relatively easy-to-access format, plus my customary overly-thorough explanations. Also it has a cool image, so.

If you would like to import the lorebook on its own, it's [here](/world-info/Max Prompts.json).
