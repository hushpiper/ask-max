Large language models are not, in general, good at writing prompts for themselves or describing how they would actually respond to a prompt: they don't have that kind of self-awareness. What they are good at is describing what a given concept means to them. I've had a surprising amount of success with simply giving Max a draft prompt and asking how it would interpret it.

Don't mistake this for Max describing what it would actually do in practice.

The trick is simply to look at the words and concepts it uses in its description to get a general sense of what the prompt means to Max in context. You're not looking for specifics: you're just exploring its headspace and noting down general associations.
