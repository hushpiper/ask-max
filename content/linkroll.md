In the Olden Days of the internet, before Google and bookmarking services made discovery easy, the only way to find websites that interested you was to find links to them on some other website.

The LLM hobbyist community is in a similar boat: a great deal of its seminal documentation is scattered across a random assortment of Rentry pages. They can usually be found via Google... *if* you already know they're there. And newcomers to the hobby--the people who most need the documentation--don't.

Hence this page!
